# Sometimes Cafe

This website is a proof of concept for an idea I had for a site that is sometimes available and sometimes not.

Nearly every relevant feature on the site is functionally broken as of now.

Built with Sveltekit (frontend) and Firebase (backend). Hosted by Firebase as well.

Note: firebaseConfig.js is missing (gitignore) because I could not figure out how to use environment variables in production :(
